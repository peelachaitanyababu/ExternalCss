    <h1>Color Detections</h1>
    <p>
      This project presents a Color Detection System that identifies and
      displays the name of colors in real-time using computer vision techniques.
      Designed to assist users in recognizing colors from images or live camera
      feeds, the system captures pixel data and matches it against a predefined
      color dataset to determine the closest color name. Built using
      Python,OpenCV, and NumPy, the application allows users to click on any
      point in an image to retrieve its RGB values and corresponding color name.
      It has practical applications in design, accessibility tools for visually
      impaired individuals, and educational environments. By combining image
      processing with intuitive user interaction, the project showcases how
      simple yet powerful tools can enhance visual understanding and user
      experience. Would you like a version thatâ€™s optimized for LinkedIn or a
      project report? I can tweak the tone or add a catchy caption to go with
      it!
